## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project folder has its own `README.md` with setup and run instructions. Generally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jan-E-ali110/30-ComputerVision-Projects.git
cd 30-ComputerVision-Projects/Face Anonymizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
python face_anonymizer.py --mode webcam
```
